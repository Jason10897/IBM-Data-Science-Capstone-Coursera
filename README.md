# IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-Coursera
Contains my work for the Capstone Project for IBM Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera. Creating this repository is a part of the course. Use this only as a reference or for study purporse. Kindly follow Coursera's Honor Code and maintain a fair environment. 

1. IBM Data Science Capstone Introduction.ipynb 
<br>Contains the assignment for the first week of the course.

2. Foursquare API.ipynb
<br>Contains the lab for the second week of the course.
<br>Note that GitHub was not able to render the folium maps in the output. Also, I have censored my Foursquare API credentials for security reasons. Kindly replace the censored code (used the * symbol 5 times) with your own Foursquare API credentials for peronal use.    

Note: GitHub may not be able to render a Jupyter Notebook in one go, so kindly reload it a few times to view the Notebook, if it does not load the first time around.
